# SocialeX
This is my social media Universal Website (SSR) Nuxtjs based startup project.
I am using firebase store for this project file store,
yes you can say - "aws s3" but since s3 is paid i used free way and firebase store,
as for deployment i could use firebase deploy or heroku but since they are paid i started looking for free way but still i can't find free vps hosting either(
so i settled on vercel.
Since vercel hosting service doesn't have ssr hosting server, I had to host in spa view (
Apologies in advance for slowing down my projectâ€¦
In my SocialeX project, you can create random posts for yourself and comment on posts, etc.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
